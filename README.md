# Week 02: Object-Oriented Programming in Java

This week, we focus on the basics of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in Java. You'll learn how to design programs using classes, objects, inheritance, interfaces, and more.

## Topics Covered

### 1. OOP Fundamentals
- What are classes and objects?
- 4 main OOP concepts: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism

### 2. Constructors, Variables, Access Modifiers

- Instance vs static variables
- Access modifiers: public, private, protected, default

### 3. this, static, final, instanceof
- Using `this` keyword
- Understanding `static` and `final`
- Type checking with `instanceof`

### 4. Object Modeling & Class Diagrams
- Basics of object modeling
- How to draw simple class diagrams

### 5. Inheritance
- Reusing code with inheritance
- Using `super` keyword
- Method overriding

### 6. Encapsulation, Interfaces, Abstract Classes, Polymorphism
- Hiding data with encapsulation
- Implementing interfaces
- Using abstract classes
- Method overloading and overriding (polymorphism)
